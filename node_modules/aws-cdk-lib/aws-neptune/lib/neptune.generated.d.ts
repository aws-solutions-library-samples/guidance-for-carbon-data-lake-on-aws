 * A CloudFormation `AWS::Neptune::DBInstance`
 *
 * The `AWS::Neptune::DBInstance` type creates an Amazon Neptune DB instance.

 * *Updating DB Instances*
 *
 * You can set a deletion policy for your DB instance to control how AWS CloudFormation handles the instance when the stack is deleted. For Neptune DB instances, you can choose to *retain* the instance, to *delete* the instance, or to *create a snapshot* of the instance. The default AWS CloudFormation behavior depends on the `DBClusterIdentifier` property:
 *
 * - For `AWS::Neptune::DBInstance` resources that don't specify the `DBClusterIdentifier` property, AWS CloudFormation saves a snapshot of the DB instance.
 * - For `AWS::Neptune::DBInstance` resources that do specify the `DBClusterIdentifier` property, AWS CloudFormation deletes the DB instance.
 *
 * *Deleting DB Instances*
 *
 * > If a DB instance is deleted or replaced during an update, AWS CloudFormation deletes all automated snapshots. However, it retains manual DB snapshots. During an update that requires replacement, you can apply a stack policy to prevent DB instances from being replaced.
 *
 * When properties labeled *Update requires: Replacement* are updated, AWS CloudFormation first creates a replacement DB instance, changes references from other dependent resources to point to the replacement DB instance, and finally deletes the old DB instance.
 *
 * > We highly recommend that you take a snapshot of the database before updating the stack. If you don't, you lose the data when AWS CloudFormation replaces your DB instance. To preserve your data, perform the following procedure:
 * >
 * > - Deactivate any applications that are using the DB instance so that there's no activity on the DB instance.
 * > - Create a snapshot of the DB instance.
 * > - If you want to restore your instance using a DB snapshot, modify the updated template with your DB instance changes and add the `DBSnapshotIdentifier` property with the ID of the DB snapshot that you want to use.
 * > - Update the stack.

 *
 * > Applying a parameter group to a DB instance might require the instance to reboot, resulting in a database outage for the duration of the reboot.
 *
 * A DB parameter group is initially created with the default parameters for the database engine used by the DB instance. To provide custom values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after creating it using *ModifyDBParameterGroup* . Once you've created a DB parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB instance using *ModifyDBInstance* . When you associate a new DB parameter group with a running DB instance, you need to reboot the DB instance without failover for the new DB parameter group and associated settings to take effect.
 *
 * > After you create a DB parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB instance that uses that DB parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon Neptune to fully complete the create action before the parameter group is used as the default for a new DB instance. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB instance, such as the character set for the default database defined by the `character_set_database` parameter. You can use the *Parameter Groups* option of the Amazon Neptune console or the *DescribeDBParameters* command to verify that your DB parameter group has been created or modified.
