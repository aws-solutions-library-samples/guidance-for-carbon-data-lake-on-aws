This can happen in one of three situations:\n *\n * - The resource is removed from the template, so CloudFormation stops managing it;\n * - A change to the resource is made that requires it to be replaced, so CloudFormation stops\n *   managing it;\n * - The stack is deleted, so CloudFormation stops managing all resources in it.\n *\n * The Removal Policy applies to all above cases.\n *\n * Many stateful resources in the AWS Construct Library will accept a\n * `removalPolicy` as a property, typically defaulting it to `RETAIN`.\n *\n * If the AWS Construct Library resource does not accept a `removalPolicy`\n * argument, you can always configure it by using the escape hatch mechanism,\n * as shown in the following example:\n *\n * ```ts\n * declare const bucket: s3.Bucket;\n *\n * const cfnBucket = bucket.node.findChild('Resource') as CfnResource;\n * cfnBucket.applyRemovalPolicy(RemovalPolicy.DESTROY);\n * ```\n */\nexport enum RemovalPolicy {\n  /**\n   * This is the default removal policy.
