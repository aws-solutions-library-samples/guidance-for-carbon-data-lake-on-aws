# Contributing

Hi! Welcome to the Contributor's guide for the carbon data lake solutions guidance with sample code. This guide takes you from "hi I'm brand new to this project" all the way through "I commit, merge, and deploy like it's my job".

Read on to find out how to set up your dev environment and get started.

## Languages and Frameworks

* Infrastructure: CDK Typescript Level 1-2-3 and Cloudformation
* Lambda Functions: Python 3.9
* Front-End: React and AWS Cloudscape
* CI/CD: Gitlab to Codecommit Mirroring via HTTPS

## Setting Up Your Dev Environment

Okay so getting set up with all the right tooling at Amazon is a little tricky, but it's not so bad. In fact once you've got the right tooling all set up your life will get way easier. But be patient, if you're new to developing with Gitlab at AWS or Amazon it's going to take a little while to remove the friction from the process.

So there are a few things you'll want to do to get started developing with Gitlab:

1. [Set up your AWS Credentials Locally](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)
3. Pick an IDE of choice -- we generally recommend VS Code (see more about vs code setup for amazon [here](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/VisualStudioCode/#HDownloadingandinstalling)), but it's up to you. Cloud9 can also be quite nice when you're doing CDK and/or Amplify work.

## Picking an Issue & Getting Started

There are two ways to start contributing to the project...

#### If you have been onboarded as a contributor and joined the Team
- You can create branches and work off of them. The directions below are all about this.
- Proceed :D

#### If you are just out here on your own looking to contribute or just want to play around and use some of our code

- Follow the same instructions below, but instead of following a branching workflow (you won't be able to bc you don't have permissions by default), you are going to fork the repository.
- When you fork the repository you can either use it for your own purposes or you can submit merge requests back with changes or updates you have made. We would love to hear about what you're doing with the fork at `#carbonlake-interest` on slack.

### 1/ Pick an Issue OR Create One 

Whew! You did it. You're up and running and now it's time to pick an issue and get started. If you've been assigned an issue that's easy-sauce. Go get started there. If you haven't been assigned an issue now is a great time to pick one. You will notice that all issues have tags (or should...at least). If this is your first time contributing we recommend you pick a `good-first-issue` tag and start there. It will be much more gratifying and let you get used to contributing. If you're not new, then we recommend you pick something that matches your general desire to commit time and your overall skillset and/or desire to learn.

If you are creating an issue or you simply have one that's not well defined please use the issue template below and fill in all the sections. Generally we try to keep issue writing simple but make sure we're covering all the details. You will keep adding details to the issue and it will make things go really awesome...

### 2/ Make sure you know what to do

So you picked an issue. Take a quick read and make sure you're really clear about what you have to do. All issues in CarbonLakeQS _should_ include an issue template that tell you allll about what you need to do. No issue template? You can either reach out to the person who wrote the issue and help them make one...or just pick a different one.

### 3/ Create a Branch or Fork

Use the "create branch" button (hint: same button as "create merge request" just click for the dropdown options). Create a new branch with `/main` as the origin. Why? Because that is the active dev environment. You can always rebase with this, but start from here. Leave the issue name as the root and add `<identifier>/issue-title/your-amazon-alias` where the idenifiers ar `feature`, `bugfix`, `hotfix`, `documentation`.

For example -- if my issue is called `my-CarbonLakeQS-issue` then gitlab has added an issue number and you're going to add you alias. The structure will be `issueNumber-issueTitle-yourAmazonAlias` so it will now look like `feature/9-my-CarbonLakeQS-issue/peccyamazonian`

As another example if you are creating documentation it might look like `documentation/add-docs-about-docs-to-docs/peccyamazonian`

_Thanks for doing that! It makes it really easy to know who is working on what and allows multiple people to maintain branches related to the same issue. Create your branch and clone away._

### 4/ Add yourself as "assignee", create a due date, comment about what you plan to do

Make sure you add yourself ass assignee, set tags to `WIP` at a minimum, and select a due date. Now write a brief comment about what you plan to do. Don't write a book, just something that makes it clear what you're working on and how you're approaching development.

### 5/ Get coding!

Follow the instructions here for:
1. [Getting started with CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/hello_world.html)
2. [Creating a CDK App with Multiple Stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/stack_how_to_create_multiple_stacks.html)


## CDK Architecture

CDK is so nice! It's very similar to Cloudformation but far easier to maintain, update, and secure. Don't believe me -- well you'll have to try. So...CarbonLakeQS is developed in CDK with TypeScript because it has the best support. Not super comfortable with TypeScript? Don't worry. You will get there. There is nothing crazy complicated in CDK.

We are using a CDK with component constructs approach to development. Why? Because that way everyone can work on their own encapsulated stacks and develop separately for shared deployment. How does this work? I will tell you...

1. Every piece of infrastructure is encapsulated in it's own CDK stack. This is basically a single CDK file that deploys everything this stack needs. Want to nest stacks within this stack? Cool. Go for it. But I recommend you just start simple with one file.
2. Okay you've got your stack. You might have a stack for storage. All your s3 buckets are going to be in this stack. This stack will live in a directory called `storage` Need to pass environmental variables to this? We get it. So you can pass them as props via Typescript. Now you've got the needed environmental variables (these might be passed from some other part of your infrastructure).
3. Okay now we've got all these stacks like `storage` and `iot` and `dashboard` and `monitoring` or something like that. Now there is a main stack that basically calls all these stacks and deploys them in order, returning any outputs needed for inputs to other stacks. Make sense?

It's just like the way cloudformation stacks work when they're deployed as nested stacks. Basically you can build a bunch of independent modules, but they all are called in succession by a main module. Sound fun? Try it out.

## Atomic Commits

Please plan to approach your contributions with the principle of Atomic Commits. So what exactly are atomic commits? Atomic commits are so small that they cannot be broken up into any smaller pieces (like an atom unless you're doing fission or fusion, but let's keep things newtonian). There are four features an atomic commit needs to have:
    1. Single Atomic Unit: Every commit pertains to one feature or fix and one feature or fix only.
    2. Everything works: Keep your commits small enough that you can validate and test them. Don't break the build.
    3. Clear and Concise: The commit message and description are clear and concise, so that anyone can understand them, even someone brand new to the project
    4. DOCUMENT IT! I said there were three, but the fourth is a super-feature -- document it. Write comments for the code and add to the readme. Your feature is only atomic if you document it so that someone else can build upon it.

### Why atomic commits?
There are a few key benefits to atomic commits:
    1. Less time spend solving merge conflicts
    2. Simplified code review
    3. Easier for other contributors to add their own features
    4. Forcing function for thorough documentation
    5. Relevant and clear history and lineage

### How to follow the principle of atomic commits
1. Only check out branches or create new branches by tagging them to an issue
2. Commit early and often. If you're wondering "shoudl I commit" you probably should
3. Keep commit messages to less than 10 words -- okay, okay, this is a general rule. But keep the sentences short and concise. In general if the message can be broken into multiple sentences you are probably jamming a few too many features in.

## Testing Your Code

Okay so we're keeping testing relatively easy here. For now. So basically please test your branches and ensure they deploy along with the full infrastructure before you make a merge request. CDK will do a lot of automated testing for you. But beyond that your testing will be your responsibility.

## Before you merge!

Before you merge you MUST do the following. If you don't, you will be sorry :laughing: 

```
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout your-branch-that-you-plan-to push
git merge main
git push
```
This process will enforce local resolution of merge conflicts before pushing to the remote upstream repo. Please resolve all conflicts to the best of your ability before pushing. If you are unsure please reach out to one of the maintainers.

Quick Note: Hey buddy! You can only make changes to this repo by merge request.

## Merge Requests

1. Select "merge requests" from the left navigation drawer
2. Select "create new merge request"
3. Select your source branch (hint, the one you've been working on) and your target branch (hint: `main`)
4. Select a reviewer and an approver. You can assign any contributor as a reviewer. You may only assign a maintainer as an approver. And don't break stuff please. Or do. That's fine also.
5. Write your comments, keep them detailed and clear. What did you do, how does it relate to the issue, what are the inputs, what are the outputs, what are the dependencies, how did you test it, what is the expected behavior?
6. Once your merge request has been approved go ahead and close the issue, your code will now be merged into the test branch for further testing and review. After it goes through there if all goes well it will be merged with dev and then eventually with prod. See approval workflow below.

## Approval Workflow

We're going to keep our approval workflow simple in the name of speed and reducing bottlenecks. Don't worry, we can always roll back changes. Thanks, git! Two rules for approvals.

1. The only people who can approve merge requests are maintainers. Consult the project information guide to view a directory of maintainers. Please add yourself as assignee and then a maintainer as the reviewer. The maintainer will approve and or send back to you for changes.

## Approval Workflow

We're going to keep our approval workflow simple in the name of speed and reducing bottlenecks. Don't worry, we can always roll back changes. Thanks, git! Always have one approver for merge to `main`. Ask them if they have the time to approve your code before you actually assign them.

## Additional Resources

#### Handy Resource: Some Git Commands for Maintaining Atomic Commits

1. Add changes to last commit:
2. Change multiple past commits: initiated interactive rebase `git rebase -i HEAD~5` where `5` is the number of commits you want to go back. Change `pick` into `e` for any commit you want to change. Then after writing and saving your file continue to the next commit with `git rebase --continue`
3. Stash your changes: stash (remove) your changes with `git stash` and retrieve them later with `git stash apply`
4. Reset a commit: `git reset HEAD~`
5. Enter interactive rebase: `git rebase -i HEAD~5` and replace `pick` with `f` for fixup. Squash does the same `s` but allows you to edit the comment message and description
5. Take a commit from another branch: find the commit with `git log`. Copy the hash. Now "cherry-pick" the commit with `git cherry-pick 1234yourhash`
