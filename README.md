# Welcome to the carbon data lake AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) application

The carbon data lake guidance with sample code implements a foundational data lake (and ingestion and processing framework) using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK). The deployed asset provides the base infrastructure for customers and partners to build their carbon accounting use cases.

__Note: This solution by itself will not make a customer compliant with any end to end carbon accounting solution. It provides the foundational infrastructure from which additional complementary solutions can be integrated.__

The carbon data lake reduces the undifferentiated heavy lifting of ingesting, standardizing, transforming, and calculating greenhouse gas emission data in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq). Customers can use this guidance with sample code to advance their starting point for building decarbonization reporting, forecasting, and analytics solutions and/or products. The carbon data lake includes a purpose-built data pipeline, data quality module, data lineage module, emissions calculator microservice, business intelligence services, prebuilt forecasting machine learning notebook and compute service, GraphQL API, and sample web application.

Customer emissions data (such as databases, historians, existing data lakes, internal/external APIs, Images, CSVs, JSON, IoT/sensor data, and third party applications including CRMs, ERPs, MES, and more) can be mapped to the standard CSV format to support centralization and processing of customer carbon data. Carbon data is ingested through the carbon data lake landing zone, and can be ingested from any service within or connected to the AWS cloud. This calculator can be deployed with a sample emissions factor model or can be modified or augmented with additional bring your own standards lookup tables and calculator logic.

## What it does

This guidance with sample code provides core functionality to accelerate data ingestion, processing, calculation, storage, analytics and insights. The following list outlines the current capabilities of the carbon data lake. Please submit a PR to request additional capabilities and features. We appreciate your feedback as we continue to improve this offering.

### Capabilities

The following list covers current capabilities as of today:

- Accepts a standard CSV formatted data input as S3 upload to the carbon data lake Landing Bucket
- Accepts multi-part and standard upload via S3 CLI, Console, and other programmatic means
- Accepts single file upload via AWS Amplify console with optional web application
- Provides daily data compaction at midnight in local time
- Performs calculation using sample calculator lookup table
- Can accept new calculator lookup table and data model with required updates to JSON files for data quality AND calculator.

## üõ† What you will build

Deploying this repository with default parameters builds the following carbon data lake environment in the AWS Cloud.

![carbon data lake diagram](resources/architecture/architecture_diagram.png)
Figure 1: Solution Architecture Diagram

As shown in Figure 1: Solution Architecture Diagram, this guidance with sample code sets up the following application stacks

1. Customer emissions data from various sources is mapped to a standard CSV upload template. The CSV is uploaded, either directly to the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) landing bucket, or through the user interface
2. Amazon S3 landing bucket provides a single landing zone for all ingested emissions data. Data ingress to the landing zone bucket triggers the data pipeline.
3. AWS Step Functions workflow orchestrates the data pipeline including data quality check, data compaction, transformation, standardization, and enrichment with an emissions calculator AWS Lambda function.
4. AWS Glue DataBrew provides data quality auditing and an alerting workflow, and Lambda functions provide integration with Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) and AWS Amplify web application.
5. AWS Lambda functions provide data lineage processing, queued by Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS). Amazon DynamoDB provides NoSQL pointer storage for the data ledger, and a Lambda function provides data lineage audit functionality, tracing all data transformations for a given record.
6. ‚ÄúAn AWS Lambda function outputs calculated CO2 equivalent emissions by referencing a DynamoDB table with Customer provided emissions factors‚Äù
7. Amazon S3 enriched bucket provides data object storage for analytics workloads and the DynamoDB calculated emissions table provides storage for GraphQL API (a query language for users API).
8. Optionally deployable artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) and business intelligence stacks provide customers with options to deploy a prebuilt Amazon SageMaker notebook and a prebuilt Amazon QuickSight dashboard. Deployments come with prebuilt Amazon Athena queries that can be used to query data stored in Amazon S3. Each service is pre-integrated with Amazon S3 enriched object storage.
9. An optionally deployable Web Application stack uses AWS Appsync to provide a GraphQL API backend for integration with web applications and other data consumer applications. AWS Amplify provides a serverless, pre-configured management application that includes basic data browsing, data visualization, data uploader, and application configuration.

## Application Stacks

### Shared Resource Stack

The shared resource stack deploys all cross-stack referenced resources such as S3 buckets and lambda functions that are built as dependencies.

Review the [Shared Resources Stack](lib/stacks/stack-shared-resources/stack-shared-resources.ts) and [Stack Outputs](#shared-resources-stack-outputs)

### Data Pipeline

The carbon data lake data pipeline is an event-driven Step Functions Workflow triggered by each upload to the carbon data lake landing zone S3 bucket. The data pipeline performs the following functions:

1. AWS Glue Data Brew Data Quality Check: If the data quality check passes the data is passed to the next step. If the data quality check fails the admin user receives a Simple Notification Services alert via email.
2. Data Transformation Glue Workflow: Batch records are transformed and prepared for the carbon data lake calculator microservice.
3. Data Compaction: night data compaction jobs prepare data for analytics and machine learning workloads.
4. Emissions calculator AWS Lambda microservice: An AWS Lambda function performed emissions factor database lookup and calculation, outputting records to a Amazon DynamoDB table and to an S3 bucket for analytics and AI/ML application.
5. Data Transformation Ledger: Each transformation of data is recorded to a ledger using Amazon Simple Queue Service, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB.

Review the [Data Pipeline Stack](lib/stacks/stack-data-pipeline/stack-data-pipeline.ts), [README](lib/stacks/stack-data-pipeline/README.md), and [Stack Outputs](#data-pipeline-stack-outputs)

### Emissions Factor Reference Database Sample

The carbon emissions calculator microservice comes with a pre-seeded Amazon DynamoDB reference table. This data model directly references the sample emissions factor model provided for development purposes. The sample data model is adapted from the [World Resource Institute (WRI) GHG Protocol Guidance](https://ghgprotocol.org/guidance-0). Please consult the WRI guidance to confirm the most up-to-date information and versions.

The sample provided is for development purposes only, and it is recommended that carbon data lake users modify this JSON document and/or create their own using a similar format. Please modify the provided data model when deploying your own application using the instructions found in the [Setup section](#-setup).

### 4/ Optional: Set up the Amplify Web Application

If you are reading this it is because you deployed the carbon data lake guidance with sample code Web Application by setting `deployWebStack: true` in the `cdk.context.json` file. Your application is already up and running in the AWS Cloud and there are a few simple steps to begin working with and editing your application.

1. Visit the AWS Amplify Console by navigating to the AWS Console and searching for Amplify. Make sure you are in the same region that you just selected to deploy your application.
2. Visit your live web application --> click on the link in the Amplify console
   When you open the web application in your browser you should see a cognito login page with input fields for an email address and password. Enter your email address and the temporary password sent to your email when you created your carbon data lake guidance with sample code CDK Application. After changing your password, you should be able to sign in successfully at this point.

   ***NOTE: The sign-up functionality is disabled intentionally to help secure your application. You may change this and add the UI elements back, or manually add the necessary users in the cognito console while following the principle of least privilege (recommended).***

6. Learn more about working with [AWS Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/) or the [AWS Amplify Console](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/js/).
7. Make the web application your own and let us know what you choose do to with it.

Success! At this point, you should successfully have the Amplify app working.

### Optional A/ Manually enable & set up Amazon Quicksight Stack

If you choose to deploy the Amazon Quicksight business intelligence stack it will include prebuilt data visualizations that leverage Amazon Athena to query your processed data. If you elect to deploy this stack you will need to remove the comments.

Before you proceed you need to set up your quicksight account and user. This needs to be done manually in the console, so please open this link and follow the instructions [here](lib/stacks/stack-quicksight/documentation/README.md).

To deploy this stack navigate to `cdk.context.json` and change `deployQuicksightStack` value to `true` and redeploy the application by running `cdk deploy --all`

### Optional B/ Manually enable & set up Forecast stack

The forecast stack includes a pre-built sagemaker notebook instance running an `.ipynb` with embedded machine learning tools and prompts.

To deploy this stack navigate to `cdk.context.json` and change `deploySagemakerStack` value to `true` and redeploy the application by running `cdk deploy --all`

## üóë How to Destroy

You can destroy all stacks included in carbon data lake guidance with sample code with `cdk destroy --all`. You can destroy individual stacks with `cdk destroy --StackName`. By default using CDK Destroy will destroy EVERYTHING. Use this with caution! We strongly recommend that you modify this functionality by applying no delete defaults within your CDK constructs. Some stacks and constructs that we recommend revising include:

- DynamoDB Tables
- S3 Buckets
- Cognito User Pools

## Work with outputs

The CDK stacks by default export all stack outputs to `cdk-outputs.json` at the top level of the directory. You can disable this feature by removing `"outputsFile": "cdk-outputs.json"` from `cdk.json` but we recommend leaving this feature, as it is a requirement for some other features. By default this file is ignored via `.gitignore` so any outputs will not be committed to a version control repository. Below is a guide to the standard outputs.

### Shared Resources Stack Outputs

Shared resource stack outputs include:

- `cdlAwsRegion`: Region of CDK Application AWS Deployment.

## üõ† Usage

Time to get started using carbon data lake guidance with sample code! Follow the steps below to see if everything is working and get familiar with this solution.

### 1/ Make sure all the infrastructure deployed properly

In your command line shell you should see confirmation of all resources deploying. Did they deploy successfully? Any errors or issues? If all is successful you should see indication that CDK deployed. You can also verify this by navigating to the Cloudformation service in the AWS console. Visually check the series of stacks that all begin with `CLQS` to see that they deployed successfully. You can also search for the tag:

```json

"application": "carbon-data-lake"

```

### 2/ Drop some synthetic test data into the carbon data lake landing zone S3 Bucket

Time to test some data out and see if everything is working. This section assumes basic prerequisite knowledge of how to manually upload an object to S3 with the AWS console. For more on this please review [how to upload an object to S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/upload-objects.html).

- Go to the S3 console and locate your carbon data lake landing zone bucket it will be called `cdlpipelinestack-cdllandingbucket` with a unique identifier appended to it
- Upload [carbon data lake synthetic input data](sample-data/carbonlake-test-synthetic-input-data.csv) to the S3 bucket manually
- This will kick trigger the pipeline kickoff lambda function and start the data pipeline step functions workflow -- continue!

### 3/ Take a look at the step functions workflow

- Navigate to step functions service in the aws console
- Select the step function named `cdlPipeline` with an appended uuid
- Select the recent active workflow
- Select from the "executions" list
- Have a quick look and familiarize yourself with the workflow graph inspector
- The workflow will highlight green for each passed step. See two image examples below.

![In-Progress Step Functions Workflow](resources/images/cdl-step-func-in-progress.png)

Figure. In progress step function workflow

![Successful Step Functions Workflow](resources/images/cdl-step-func-graph-inspector-completed.png)
Figure. Completed step function workflow

### 3/ Review your calculated outputs

The calculator outputs emissions calculator outputs referenced in the data model section below. Outputs are written to Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon S3. You can review the outputs using the AWS console or AWS CLI:

- Amazon DynamoDB: Navigate to Amazon DynamoDB in the AWS console. Look for a Database called `DataBase` and a table called `Table`
- Amazon S3: Navigate to S3 in the console and look for a bucket called `BucketName`. This bucket contains all calculator outputs.

You can also query this data using the GraphQL API detailed below.

### 4/ Query your GraphQL API endpoint

- Navigate to AWS AppSync in the console
- In the AWS AppSync, choose the Queries tab and then enter the following text in the editor:
- Run the following query and hit "run"

This one will get all of the records (with a default limit of 10)

```
query MyQuery {
  all {
    items {
      activity
      activity_event_id
      asset_id
      category
      emissions_output
      geo
      origin_measurement_timestamp
      raw_data
      units
      source
      scope
    }
  }
}
```

Did that all work? Continue...

### 5/ Take a look at the Amplify Sample Web Application

If you have not yet this is a great time to deploy the sample web application. Once you've run some data through the pipeline you should see that successfully populating in the application. Remember that to deploy the web application you will need to set `"deployWebStack": "true"` in `cdk.context.json`.

### 6/ Try dropping some other sample data into the landing zone

- Generate or select some additional data (it can be anything really, but carbon emissions data is good)
- Test out the data quality module by dropping different data into the bucket. Does it run through? Do you get a notification if it does not?

### 7/ Start connecting your own data to the carbon data lake landing zone

- Connect other data sources such as IoT, Streaming Data, Database Migration Workloads, or other applications to the S3 landing zone bucket. Try something out and let us know how it goes.

## üß™ Tests

This application currently includes unit tests, infrastructure tests, deployment tests. We are working on an end to end testing solution as well. Read on for the test details:

### Pipeline Tests

For Gitlab users only -- The Gitlab CI runs each time you commit to remote and/or merge to main. This runs automatically and does the following:

#### Static Tests
- `npm ci` installs all dependencies from `package.lock.json`
- `npm run build` builds the javascript from typescript and makes sure everything works!
- `cdk synth` synthesizes all CDK stacks in the application
- Runs bandit security tests for common vulnerabilities in Python
- Runs ESLint for common formatting issues in Javascript and Typescript

#### Security Tests
- cdk_nag
- git-secrets
- Chechov
- semgrep
- python bandit

#### Deployment Tests
- Runs CDKitten deployment tests -- these deploy your CDK in several major AWS regions, checking that it builds and deploys successfully, and then destroying those stacks after confirming that they build.
- Runs e2e data integration test -- runs an end to end test by dropping data into the pipeline and querying the GraphQL api output. If the test is successful it returns `Success`

### Manual Tests

You can run several of these tests manually on your local machine to check that everything is working as expected.

- `sh test-deployment.sh` Runs CDKitten locally using your assumed AWS role
- `sh test-e2e.sh`runs an end to end test by dropping data into the pipeline and querying the GraphQL api output. If the test is successful it returns `Success`
- `npm run lint` tests your code locally with the prebuilt linter configuration

## Extending carbon data lake

If you are looking to utilize existing features of carbon data lake while integrating your own features, modules, or applications this section provides details for how to ingest your data to the carbon data lake data pipeline, how to connect data outputs, how to integrate other applications, and how to integrate other existing AWS services. As we engage with customers this list of recommendations will grow with customer use-cases. Please feel free to submit issues that describe use-cases you would like to be documented.

### Ingesting data into carbon data lake

To ingest data into carbon data lake you can use various inputs to get data into the carbon data lake landing zone S3 bucket. This bucket can be found via AWS Console or AWS CLI under the name `bucketName`. It can also be accessed as a public readonly stack output via props `stackOutputName`. There are several methods for bringing data into an S3 bucket to start an event-driven pipeline. This article is a helpful resource as you explore options. Once your data is in S3 it will kick off the pipeline and the data quality check will begin.

### Integrating carbon data lake data outputs

### General Guide to adding features

To add additional features to carbon data lake we recommend developing your own stack that integrates with the existing carbon data lake stack inputs and outputs. We recommend starting by reviewing the concepts of application, stack, and construct in AWS CDK. Adding a stack is the best way to add functionality to carbon data lake.

1. Start by adding your own stack directory to `lib/stacks`

    ```sh
    mkdir lib/stacks/stack-title
    ```

2. Add a stack file to this directory

    ```sh
    touch lib/stacks/stack-title/stack-title.ts
    ```

3. Use basic CDK stack starter code to formulate your own stack. See example below:

    ```javascript
    import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
    import { Construct } from 'constructs';
    // import * as sqs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-sqs';

    export class ExampleStack extends cdk.Stack {
        constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
        super(scope, id, props);

        // The code that defines your stack goes here

        // example resource
        // const queue = new sqs.Queue(this, 'ExampleStackQueue', {
        //   visibilityTimeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(300)
        // });
        }
    }
    ```

4. We recommend using a single stack, and integrating additional submodular components as constructs. Constructs are logical groupings of AWS resources with "sane" defaults. In many cases the CDK team has already created a reusable construct and you can simply work with that. But in specific cases you may way to create your own. You can create a construct using the commands and example below:

    ```sh
    mkdir lib/constructs/construct-title
    touch lib/constructs/construct-title/title-construct.ts
    ```

5. If you have integrated your stack successfully you should see it build when you run `cdk synth`. For development purposes we recommend deploying your stack in isolation before you deploy with the full application. You can run `cdk deploy YourStackName` to deploy in isolation.

6. Integrate your stack with the full application by importing it to `bin/main.ts` and `bin/cicd.ts` if you have chosen to deploy it.

    ```sh
    #open the file main.ts
    open main.ts
    ```

    ```javascript
    // Import your stack at the top of the file
    import {YourStackName} from './stacks/stack-title/your-stack'

    // Now create a new stack to deploy within the application
    const stackName = new YourStackName(app, "YourStackTitle", {
        // these are props that serve as an input to your stack
        // these are optional, but could include things like S3 bucket names or other outputs of other stacks.
        // For more on this see the stack output section above.
        yourStackProp1: prop1,
        yourStackProp2: prop2,
        env: appEnv // be sure to include this environment prop
    })
    ```

#### Working with Stack Outputs

You can access the outputs of application stacks by adding them as props to your stack inputs. For example, you can access the `myVpc` output by adding `networkStack.myVpc` as props your own stack. It is best practice to add this as props at the application level, and then as an interface at the stack level. Finally, you can access it via `props.myVpc` (or whatever you call it) within your stack. Below is an example.

```javascript

// Start by importing it when you instatiate your stack üëá
new MyFirstStack(app, 'MyFirstStack', {
    vpc: networkStack.myVpc
});

// Now export this as an interface within that stack üëá
export interface MySecondStackProps extends StackProps {
    vpc: Ec2.vpc
}

// Now access it as a prop where you need it within the stack üëá
this.myStackObject = new ec2.SecurityGroup(this, 'ec2SecurityGroup', {
            props.vpc,
            allowAllOutbound: true,
        });

```

The above is a theoretical example. We recommend reviewing the CDK documentation and the existing stacks to see more examples.

### Sample and bring your own emissions factor models

The json document below is a sample emissions factor model for testing and development purposes only. To use this solution or develop your own related solution please customize and update your own emissions factor models to represent your reporting requirements.

[Sample Emissions Factor Model](lib/stacks/stack-data-pipeline/construct-calculator/emissions_factor_model_2022-05-22.json). This is the lookup table used for coefficient inputs to the calculator microservice.

Calculation methodologies reflected in this solution are aligned with the sample model, and this calculator stack may require modification if a new model is applied. To review calculation methodology and lookup tables please review the [carbon data lake Emissions Calculator Stack](lib/stacks/stack-data-pipeline/construct-calculator/README.md).

### Troubleshooting

For users with an Apple M1 chip, you may run into the following error when executing npm commands: "no matching version found for node-darwin-amd64@16.4.0" or similar terminal error output depending on the version of node you are running. If this happens, execute the following commands from your terminal in order (this fix assumes you have node version manager (nvm) installed). In this example, we will use node version 16.4.0. Replace the node version in these commands with the version you are running:
```sh
nvm uninstall 16.4.0
```
```sh
arch -x86_64 zsh
```
```sh
nvm install 16.4.0
```
```sh
nvm alias default 16.4.0
```
